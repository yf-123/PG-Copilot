def create_git_repo(self, folder_name: str):
    """
    Creates a new folder inside the base directory, initializes a Git repository, and creates 
    initial files such as README.md and .gitignore in the newly created folder.

    Args:
        folder_name (str): The name of the folder to be created, which will house the Git repository.

    Steps:
        1. Defines the base directory where the new folder will be created.
        2. Constructs the full path by combining the base directory with the folder name.
        3. Creates the folder (if it doesn't already exist).
        4. Changes the current working directory to the newly created folder.
        5. Initializes a Git repository in the folder and creates an initial README.md and .gitignore file.

    Raises:
        Exception: If an error occurs during folder creation, changing directories, or running Git commands.
